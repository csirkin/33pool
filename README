The allocate.pl script creates player to team allocations for an NFL 33 Pool. Players are randomly matched to a team each week for 17 weeks. It assumes that you'll have 32 players.

To start modify the players.txt file replacing the personXX entries with your players names.

Then run allocate.pl. The output will be 17 sets of allocations listing a player and team, comma delimited list.
